Hi there!


This site is for my thoughts and musings on a variety of topics including analytics engineering, complexity economics, data science, and product management.

I'm a political science graduate who has spent most of my professional career building business intelligence tools, so my writing will likely also touch on how to upgrade both markets and democracy with data science.

I'm applying the advice from Peter Norvig's ["Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) for Data Science.  If you have an opportunity or project that you think fits well with what you see on here, then please reach out at the contact address below.
