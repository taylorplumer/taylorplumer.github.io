## Context
In Spring 2020, I volunteered as a section instructor for an experimental computer science course offered by Stanford.

The course was modeled based on Stanford's *CS106A-Programming Methodology*.

A key differentiator for this course was the implementation of an online "section", a weekly 40 minute gathering of 8-12 students with a section instructor to reinforce key concepts introduced.

Below are the key takeaways after completion of the course.


### 1. Completion Rate
- Based on stats I came across on the forums, there was a 50% completion rate.
- Compared to a 10-15% industry average, this was pretty good! Of course, this can't be taken at face value since it's not an apples to apples comparison, but I would love to see more research in this subject area.
- This model only scales with having a sufficient number of section leaders, so more experimentation will need to be done to evaluate the economics of it.

### 2. Accountability
- Section was able to provide consistent (weekly) accountability for those that opted-in.
- I saw a lot of smiles from students on Zoom when I mentioned that section would be “code AND community”.

### 3. Momentum
- Sections went better when I focused on “building momentum” vs packing in as much information as possible in 40 minutes.
- The key was reinforcing what students had already learned during the week and not overwhelm with information overload.

### 4. Peer Learning
- Peer learning within the section wasn’t that engaging, which I attribute to the code of conduct preventing students from sharing code.
- I was impressed with the helpful support that students and section leaders provided each other in the Ed discussion platform. Code couldn't be shared, but I was impressed by students providing thoughtful hints on how to to go about solving the problems.

### 5. Humor Works.
- I used the meme below after the first assignment.
- It resonated with the students; they referred to it throughout the section to articulate their experiences working on (and solving!) the assignment.
- Memes are a great way for students to take on the identity of being a programmer.

## Next Steps
 Many students mentioned in the last section that they were already looking at next courses to continue their coding journey!

 I felt fortunate in contributing to an effort making programming more inclusive to a broader populace.

 Coding in popular culture is often portrayed as an individual pursuit, so I'm hopeful that experiments like this one can nudge us as a community to provide more collaborative learning environments for students moving forward.
